# Rock-versus-mine-prediction

Prototyped a project to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately distinguishing between rocks and mines using sonar signals. This project involves collecting sonar data, preprocessing it to extract meaningful features, and training a classifier to predict whether a given sonar signal reflects off a rock or a mine. By using techniques such as feature extraction, model training, and evaluation, the project aims to create a reliable system that enhances underwater detection and navigation capabilities, potentially aiding in maritime safety and military operations.
Built a machine learning model using logistic regression to classify objects as rocks or mines based on sonar data.
Achieved 83% accuracy on training data and 76% accuracy on test data through data pre-processing, feature engineering, and model optimization.
